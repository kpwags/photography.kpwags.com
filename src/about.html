<h1 class="capitalized">About Me</h1>

<p>Hi üëãüèª. My name is Keith, I'm a 30-something year old web developer living in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
    I graduated from Drexel University in 2007 with my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and have since spent my career
    working on both front-end and back-end development with a specialty in the .NET ecosystem. I am fortunate to have found
    a career where I can do what I love doing. Seeing websites and applications come to life is such an awesome thing, even
    more so when you're the one building them.</p>

<p>This site is my little oasis within the wide world of the internet. I often write about things I read or hear, challenges
    I find, and a variety of things going on in my busy life. You can check out my writing and other content on my
    <a href="https://kpwags.com">main site</a>.</p>

<p> I have a wide variety of interests which always keeps me busy. Some of them include: software development, photography,
    writing, hockey, running, cooking, drawing, video games, and more. In reality, it's too much to constantly keep up with,
    but I stumble through.</p>
